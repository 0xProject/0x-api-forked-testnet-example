# 0x API mainnet forking Hardhat example

This project demonstrates how you can use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) to fork the Ethereum mainnet and run tests on your private fork using quotes from using production Ethereum 0x API.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo, and then run `npm install`.
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your own `RPC_URL`
1. The example test is located in `test/index.ts` and can be executed with `npx hardhat test`

After running `npx hardhat test` you should see an output similar to this, confirming that your mainnet quote was successfully executed on your private fork

```shell
